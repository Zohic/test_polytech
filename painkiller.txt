Rivers of madness,
Are flowing through my veins.
Ain't no forgiveness,
And all I got is pain!

Never surrender,
Never give in.
I'm the defender,
And I'm gonna kill to win!

Looking for shelter,
I've no place to hide.

Evil helter skelter,
You're in for a ride!

Hear the thunder,
Terrorizing zeal.
I am the hunter,
I'm the law of steel!

Kill the pain!
Death will reign!
Love for hate!
So let the games begin!
